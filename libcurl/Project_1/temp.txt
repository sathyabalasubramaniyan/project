REST

A
RESTful
Tutorial
				

Hey,
Fellow
REST
API
Designer!
				
Building
RESTful
web
services,
like
other
programming
skills
is

part
art,
part
science.
As
the
Internet
industry
progresses,
creating
a
REST
API
becomes
more
concrete
with
emerging
best
practices.
As
RESTful
web
services
don't
follow
a
prescribed
standard
except
for
HTTP,
it's
important
to
build
your
RESTful
API
in
accordance
with
industry
best
practices
to
ease
development
and
increase
client
adoption.
				
Presently,
there
aren't
a
lot
of
REST
API
guides
to
help
the
lonely
developer.

RestApiTutorial.com
is
dedicated
to
tracking
REST
API
best
practices
and
making
resources
available
to
enable
quick
reference
and
self
education
for
the
development
crafts
person.

We'll
discuss
both
the
art
and
science
of
creating
REST
Web
services.

and
